# Machine-learning-MECs

A machine learningâ€“based workflow for predicting and optimizing multi-element catalyst (MEC) performance through a combination of neural networks (MLP) and genetic algorithms (GA).   
The GA generates new candidate compositions based on fitness values predicted by the trained MLP model, enabling iterative optimization toward optimal catalyst performance.  
This repository provides the full code for model training, GA-guided optimization, and performance evaluation.To interpret model predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) 
was employed to quantify the contribution of each element (Ni, Co, Fe, Pd, Pt) to the predicted catalytic performance.
